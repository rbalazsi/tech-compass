* TestNG's injection capabilities
 - Since TestNG can automatically inject the test Method as one of the @DataProvider's parameters, this allows runtime discovery of
its annotations (in order to define the resource file with it) and its parameters (in order to map them as columns in the resource).
 - More info: http://testng.org/doc/documentation-main.html#dependency-injection

* CSV parsing in Java
Use Apache Commons CSV

* Excel parsing in Java
Use Apache POI
 - Artifact 'org.apache.poi:poi' for the old XLS format
 - Artifact 'org.apache.poi:poi-ooxml' for the new XLSX format
 - POI has the common abstractions Workbook, Sheet, Row and Cell, making the underlying formats transparent
 - Workbook has two key implementations: XSSFWorkbook for XLSX and HSSFWorkbook for XLS
